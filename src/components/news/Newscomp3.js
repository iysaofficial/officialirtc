            In another part, Vice Rector Prof. Dr. dr. I Putu Gede Adiatmika,
            M.Kes. welcomed Unud to be trusted to host this activity. "Unud was
            invited to cooperate by IYSA in order to organize a competition
            program which began with an MoU, then we asked the KUI team to
            follow up on this cooperation," he said.

          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            With this cooperation, he said, it could support the
            internationalization program of Unud. The name Udayana will
            certainly be known in various countries. "That way, we want to
            utilize all the potential that is the advantage of Unud to the
            outside participants. Hopefully they will be involved in many
            international programs of Unud," he said. Further meaning, he said,
            Unud wants to cooperate with various participants from abroad. With
            the existing networking, we hope it will be followed up with
            international cooperation with various countries. (sar)
